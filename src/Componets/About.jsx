        <p>
          I'm Thierry Munderi, a frontend developer with a strong passion for
          crafting responsive, accessible, and high-performance web
          applications. I specialize in JavaScript and modern frameworks like
          React, with a keen eye for clean UI design and seamless user
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My workflow combines technical precision with creative
          problem-solving--whether it's building reusable components, optimizing
          performance, or integraing APIs. I thrive in fast-paced environments
          where quality, scalability, and maintainability are priorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love turning ideas into functional, beautiful interfaces-- and I'm
          always looking for new challenges that push the boundaries that the
          web can do.
        </p>
